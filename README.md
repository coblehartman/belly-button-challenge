# belly_button_biodiversity_dashboard

## Overview
A biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory is researching bacteria found in belly button. Many bacterial species are not well studied and many remain unknown to science. Rosa's role is to discover and document these bacteria. More importantly find bacteria that have ability to synthesis protein that taste like beef. They have tied up with improbable beef, a food startup. They have a hypothesis that bacteria found on human body, in the belly button, has bacterial species that can synthesis protein that can taste like beef
Purpose of this project was to build research dashboard and have report that shows bacterial species that lives across human subject ID no's belly button. The dashboard also shows specific details based on subject ID dynamically.

## Analysis 

Tools used to built the interactive dashboard are:
    - VS Code: text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.
    - Web browser: Chrome was used as browser
    - Command-line interface: to run a local server. 
    - GitHub: Deploy final data visualization on GitHub 
    - Plotly and D3 in index. html to built the graphs and display results 
    -specific functions such as sort, map and filter 

### Building Demographic Panel

### Gauge

## Results

The final web page displayed as follows

The gauge can be further enhanced by building it to show an arrow that would point dynamically acrosss the guage scale however, in this case it is displaying a value that corresponds to the subject ID selected from the dropdown. 
This information serves as a baseline to further enhance the webpage and display data on dashboard that can be used effectively for biodiversity research project.
